#ZanoPR

All the projects for the organization Zano go here.
Please check the repositories tab to see all the projects we're currently working on.
There are many private repositories as we're still working on a lot of other projects, this doesn't mean that we're not working on anything,
just we're working on projects that are a work in progress and are not fully yet well made and ready to be released out to the public. If you have any questions please contact us through: admin@zanopr.org
We will try and respond as quickly as possible
